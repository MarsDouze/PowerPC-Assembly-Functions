#Add new lines in the following format:
#	"Character Name" = ID
#So, for example, the following line...
#	"Daisy" = 80
#...would add an entry for a character called Daisy with an ID of 80
#Additionally, note that you can change the IDs for existing characters this way as well
#For example, adding the line...
#	"Mario" = 10
#...would change Mario's ID from 0 to 10.
#Finally, note that all ID values are in decimal.
